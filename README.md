# Hospital-Management-System

A comprehensive system developed using the concepts of OOP for managing hospital staff, patients, and administrative tasks. Applied Singleton to make sure there is only one object created of ‘Admin’ class and developed an observer pattern-based notification system for real-time updates between hospital staff and administrative units.Also used smart pointers to prevent memory leaks and handled runtime errors using try-catch block.
